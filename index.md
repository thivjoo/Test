# Getting Started with Wifi Settings Validation
Unified API to retrieve wifi settings validation rules and to validate the custom ssis/passphrase.

Currently, the client is retrieving the validation rules and default wifi settings from the legacy activation application and performing validation of custom ssid/password on their end.
For our next-gen, the idea is to have a centralized source of truth for the validation rules and also give an option for the validation of those rules on the platform side as well.Â
